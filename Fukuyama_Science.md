# Fukuyama's Scientific and Technological Universal History

In which I try to explain Francis Fukyuyama's ideas about a scientific and technological universal history as he explains it in "The End of History and the Last Man". All quotes are from this book unless otherwise stated, as are the ideas.


## What is a universal history and what might be its mechanism?

A "universal history" is "an attempt to find a meaningful pattern in the overall development of of human societies generally". A key assumption is the basic continuity of history, in a way that surpasses the mere repetition of cycles. In the Western tradition, the first Universal Histories were Christian and the first secular versions of a Universal History originated with the progress being made with the scientific method. 

Modern natural science provided a metric upon which a clear notion of "progress" could be tied to. Progress was the cumulative and possibly endless quest for knowledge. A French intellectual in the 17th century, Fontenelle, described it thus: 
   
   > "A good cultivated mind contains, so to speak, all minds of preceding centuries; it is but a single identical mind which has been developing and improving itself all the time". 

Fukuyama stakes his attempt to show the directionality of human history on there being a constant and uniform mechanism that dictates historical evolution in a certain direction and also "preserves the memory of earlier periods into the present" to prevent repetition. Agreeing with intellectuals of the past, he agrees that __knowledge__ is the mechanism of directionality, specifically and most un-ambiguously scientifically derived knowledge of the natural universe. Scientific knowledge is not all knowledge, or even most, but it is the one which most clearly accumulates in a way accessible and usable to all. 
   

## What drives scientific progress and what regular effects on human society does it have?
        
The accumulation of knowledge, abstract but more often encoded in specific practices, from agriculture to metallurgy, is ancient. The discovery of the scientific method, however, qualitatively changed the relationship of scientific knowledge to the historical process. It did this by increasing the pace and by formulating it in a way that it scientific knowledge could "become a universal possession of rational man" unhindered by contingent cultural differences. Fukuyama's Universal History driven by science truly begins with modern natural science, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries onward. 

Scientific progress is not, for now, entirely autonomous of man. It was neglected by man for thousands of years and could be neglected for thousands more, if the consequences and uses of scientific knowledge did not force men to adopt its logic. These consequences are not because of the knowledge in itself, but what men do with it. The scientific method is obviously the tool, along with human intelligence _does_ science. But what encourages, even requires its use and forces its discoveries to be accepted and taught?
 
Fukuyama describes two interactions on the individual and group level, which directly motivate the scientific and technological endeavor. The first is military competition. The second is the progressive conquest of nature to satisfy human desires, also called economic development. 

The effect of these processes on society may be summed up with a pithy Lenin quote describing the cause and requirement of specialization. He describes, "Specialization necessarily pre-supposes centralization and in its turn imperatively calls for it". 
   
This is only true to a point, but it does account for most of the societal changes technology has encouraged. Fukuyama cites one statistic that highlights this.

  > In contrast to the nineteenth century, when four out of five Americans were self-employed and therefore not part of a bureaucratic organization, only one in ten falls into this category now. 
        
State capacity had to develop to mobilize resources on national level, to increase education levels to have an elite capable of understanding and using technology. The poorer classes had to be placated with varying levels of political enfranchisement as they wielded weapons in wars of mass mobilization (the Napoleonic Wars onward). Collaboration and participation on a mass level, economically and otherwise, spurred greater linguistic homogeneity both naturally and through national policy. 
  
 A good example of specialization depending on and then further encouraging centralization is the emergence of absolute monarchies and aspects of the modern state under monarchs such as Louis XIII in France or Philip II in Spain. Largely motivated by war in this case, both broke the power of feudal and regional institutions in order to collect enough revenue for constant warfare. 

Only certain forms of social structures could produce and deploy technology competitively and this is the source of the uniform effect of technology on society. The possibility of war alone motivates these effects. Societies that neglected technology might be conquered and subjugated to the global technological process without their consent, but they could also respond preemptively on their own terms. For example, Japan realized that it had to absorb Western technology to keep its independence after an American navy expedition (Commodore Perry in 1853) persuaded them to open the country. Japan rapidly modernized by introducing state run compulsory education, a mass peasant army, and national taxation and currency systems under the Meiji restoration. The persistence of the possibility of war after major wars required the maintenance and even further development of military technologies  -- the atom bomb is a good example here. 
 
Economic development is is regulated by natural science because science establishes a "constantly changing horizon of production possibilities". The deployment of these possibilities is enabled by certain social technologies, largely described as the "rational organization of labor". This is what produces certain uniform social transformations, already described. Industrial societies that are predominantly urban is the logical next step in societal specialization and centralization, though the individual as laborer becomes increasingly mobile to meet the demands of the labor market. This has a corrosive effect on various traditional social groups, from the tribe to the extended family to various religious sects. Further analysis and examples of this may be explored another time. 

## Conclusion

So, why does science as a social phenomena unfold? Science permits men to satisfy their desires for security and the limitless acquisition of material goods. It serves as a driver and explanation of modern post scientific historical evolution because as a means of satisfying these desires (along with the related means of technology, including social) it imposes certain conditions, sometimes unanticipated but always universal. 
 
 What does the scientific mechanicism explain in history? 
         > many of the specific details of historical evolution, for example, why men moved by horse-drawn carriage and railroad before they went by automobile and airplane, or why later societies are more urbanized than earlier ones, or why the modern political party, labor union, or nation-state has replaced the tribe or clan as the primary axis of group loyalty in industrialized societies
         
 What I do not get into here, and what Fukuyama does address later in his book, is the theory of human nature that accounts for the human desires he references. He also admits that technological, scientific development does not explain _all_ of history. In fact, it explains only a very limited aspect of the form which the state takes, and barely accounts for democracy. All this deserves a post of its own, which I may eventually write. For now, I have presented a hopefully sensible and compelling explanation of the scientific and technological universal history Fukuyama argues for, that is one part of his broader theory. 
 
Something Fukuyama does not really discuss, and which I would like to address in another post sometime, using "The Technological Society" by Jacques Ellul as a source, is the difference between technology and science. Fukuyama acknowledges the difference, but does not go beyond that, mostly lumping them together as two forces intrinsically linked. This ambiguity is left alone in this post, but deserves attention, as a large amount of the changes science encourages according to Fukuyama are the application of rational but not scientific techniques; the unity of science and rational techniques is by no means a historical constant. The inventor of the steam engine did not need the scientific theory which explained the steam engine. 

One last question untouched but relevant here, is to what extent scientific progress will continue. Fukuyama does not try to answer that question and neither do I. The theory of history here accounts for the role of science in the past and its role if it continutes to progress, stay useful. He does address what factors cause scientific knowledge and technological techniques to be 'sticky', remain unforgotten and in use. He concludes that even in the case of a collapse in technological civilization, the same methods would likely emerge as long as human nature stayed similar enough. A new religion or culture which entirely rejected technological, scientific civilization and subjugated it to another end is always possible, but unlikely to change the course of history unless it can somehow capture the obedience of the entire world or remain in isolation consistently.
